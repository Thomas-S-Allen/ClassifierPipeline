2017Natur.542..456G,Astronomy,Planetary Science,Seven temperate terrestrial planets around the nearby ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1,"One aim of modern astronomy is to detect temperate, Earth-like exoplanets that are well suited for atmospheric characterization. Recently, three Earth-sized planets were detected that transit (that is, pass in front of) a star with a mass just eight per cent that of the Sun, located 12 parsecs away. The transiting configuration of these planets, combined with the Jupiter-like size of their host star—named TRAPPIST-1—makes possible in-depth studies of their atmospheric properties with present-day and future astronomical facilities. Here we report the results of a photometric monitoring campaign of that star from the ground and space. Our observations reveal that at least seven planets with sizes and masses similar to those of Earth revolve around TRAPPIST-1. The six inner planets form a near-resonant chain, such that their orbital periods (1.51, 2.42, 4.04, 6.06, 9.1 and 12.35 days) are near-ratios of small integers. This architecture suggests that the planets formed farther from the star and migrated inwards. Moreover, the seven planets have equilibrium temperatures low enough to make possible the presence of liquid water on their surfaces.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.18382839858531952, 0.0014123921282589436, 0.7986019849777222, 0.005161432083696127, 0.012509947642683983, 0.0004701763391494751, 0.0009523532935418189, 0.00019923345826100558]",0.18382839858531952,0.0014123921282589436,0.7986019849777222,0.005161432083696127,0.012509947642683983,0.0004701763391494751,0.0009523532935418189,0.00019923345826100558
2022Natur.601..334Z,Astronomy,Heliophysics,Star formation near the Sun is driven by expansion of the Local Bubble,"For decades we have known that the Sun lies within the Local Bubble, a cavity of low-density, high-temperature plasma surrounded by a shell of cold, neutral gas and dust<SUP>1-3</SUP>.

We find that nearly all of the star-forming complexes in the solar vicinity lie on the surface of the Local Bubble and that their young stars show outward expansion mainly perpendicular to the bubble's surface. Tracebacks of these young stars' motions support a picture in which the origin of the Local Bubble was a burst of stellar birth and then death (supernovae) taking place near the bubble's centre beginning approximately 14 Myr ago. The expansion of the Local Bubble created by the supernovae swept up the ambient interstellar medium into an extended shell that has now fragmented and collapsed into the most prominent nearby molecular clouds, in turn providing robust observational support for the theory of supernova-driven star formation.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.6545196175575256, 0.12378892302513123, 0.11947963386774063, 0.0022781151346862316, 0.04115134850144386, 0.0007133448380045593, 0.0004805362841580063, 0.00027309972210787237]",0.6545196175575256,0.12378892302513123,0.11947963386774063,0.0022781151346862316,0.04115134850144386,0.0007133448380045593,0.0004805362841580063,0.00027309972210787237

Various physical observations collected during its visit to the Solar System showed that it has an unusually elongated shape and a tumbling rotation state and that the physical properties of its surface resemble those of cometary nuclei, even though it showed no evidence of cometary activity. The motion of all celestial bodies is governed mostly by gravity, but the trajectories of comets can also be affected by non-gravitational forces due to cometary outgassing. Because non-gravitational accelerations are at least three to four orders of magnitude weaker than gravitational acceleration, the detection of any deviation from a purely gravity-driven trajectory requires high-quality astrometry over a long arc. As a result, non-gravitational effects have been measured on only a limited subset of the small-body population. Here we report the detection, at 30σ significance, of non-gravitational acceleration in the motion of 'Oumuamua.

The atmospheres of orbiting Earth-sized planets are observationally accessible via transmission spectroscopy when the planets pass in front of these stars. Statistical results suggest that the nearest transiting Earth-sized planet in the liquid-water, habitable zone of an M dwarf star is probably around 10.5 parsecs away. A temperate planet has been discovered orbiting Proxima Centauri, the closest M dwarf, but it probably does not transit and its true mass is unknown. Seven Earth-sized planets transit the very low-mass star TRAPPIST-1, which is 12 parsecs away, but their masses and, particularly, their densities are poorly constrained. Here we report observations of LHS 1140b, a planet with a radius of 1.4 Earth radii transiting a small, cool star (LHS 1140) 12 parsecs away. We measure the mass of the planet to be 6.6 times that of Earth, consistent with a rocky bulk composition. LHS 1140b receives an insolation of 0.46 times that of Earth, placing it within the liquid-water, habitable zone. With 90 per cent confidence, we place an upper limit on the orbital eccentricity of 0.29. The circular orbit is unlikely to be the result of tides and therefore was probably present at formation. Given its large surface gravity and cool insolation, the planet may have retained its atmosphere despite the greater luminosity (compared to the present-day) of its host star in its youth. Because LHS 1140 is nearby, telescopes currently under construction might be able to search for specific atmospheric gases in the future.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.05529740825295448, 0.0013397621223703027, 0.9341179728507996, 0.005867993924766779, 0.009692265652120113, 0.0005612189997918904, 0.0011119276750832796, 0.00024669061531312764]",0.05529740825295448,0.0013397621223703027,0.9341179728507996,0.005867993924766779,0.009692265652120113,0.0005612189997918904,0.0011119276750832796,0.00024669061531312764

We present optical polarimetric observations of the black hole x-ray binary MAXI J1820+070, from which we constrain the position angle of the binary orbital. Combining this with previous determinations of the relativistic jet orientation, which traces the black hole spin, and the inclination of the orbit, we determine a lower limit of 40° on the spin-orbit misalignment angle. The misalignment must originate from either the binary evolution or black hole formation stages. If other x-ray binaries have similarly large misalignments, these would bias measurements of black hole masses and spins from x-ray observations.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.9909274578094482, 0.0018189549446105957, 0.0022461689077317715, 0.0022157118655741215, 0.0054360851645469666, 0.0015009420458227396, 0.0012773307971656322, 0.0002553275553509593]",0.9909274578094482,0.0018189549446105957,0.0022461689077317715,0.0022157118655741215,0.0054360851645469666,0.0015009420458227396,0.0012773307971656322,0.0002553275553509593

2017Natur.551..478H,Heliophysics,Astronomy,Solar abundance ratios of the iron-peak elements in the Perseus cluster,"The metal abundance of the hot plasma that permeates galaxy clusters represents the accumulation of heavy elements produced by billions of supernovae. Therefore, X-ray spectroscopy of the intracluster medium provides an opportunity to investigate the nature of supernova explosions integrated over cosmic time. In particular, the abundance of the iron-peak elements (chromium, manganese, iron and nickel) is key to understanding how the progenitors of typical type Ia supernovae evolve and explode. Recent X-ray studies of the intracluster medium found that the abundance ratios of these elements differ substantially from those seen in the Sun, suggesting differences between the nature of type Ia supernovae in the clusters and in the Milky Way. However, because the K-shell transition lines of chromium and manganese are weak and those of iron and nickel are very close in photon energy, high-resolution spectroscopy is required for an accurate determination of the abundances of these elements. Here we report observations of the Perseus cluster, with statistically significant detections of the resonance emission from chromium, manganese and nickel. Our measurements, combined with the latest atomic models, reveal that these elements have near-solar abundance ratios with respect to iron, in contrast to previous claims. Comparison between our results and modern nucleosynthesis calculations disfavours the hypothesis that type Ia supernova progenitors are exclusively white dwarfs with masses well below the Chandrasekhar limit (about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun). The observed abundance pattern of the iron-peak elements can be explained by taking into account a combination of near- and sub-Chandrasekhar-mass type Ia supernova systems, adding to the mounting evidence that both progenitor types make a substantial contribution to cosmic chemical enrichment.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.38081562519073486, 0.31945809721946716, 0.07557511329650879, 0.0033247433602809906, 0.03190995752811432, 0.00046179138007573783, 0.00038937164936214685, 0.00024319854856003076]",0.38081562519073486,0.31945809721946716,0.07557511329650879,0.0033247433602809906,0.03190995752811432,0.00046179138007573783,0.00038937164936214685,0.00024319854856003076

2017Natur.544..452W,Heliophysics,FALSE,A universal model for solar eruptions,"Magnetically driven eruptions on the Sun, from stellar-scale coronal mass ejections to small-scale coronal X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet jets, have frequently been observed to involve the ejection of the highly stressed magnetic flux of a filament. Theoretically, these two phenomena have been thought to arise through very different mechanisms: coronal mass ejections from an ideal (non-dissipative) process, whereby the energy release does not require a change in the magnetic topology, as in the kink or torus instability; and coronal jets from a resistive process involving magnetic reconnection. However, it was recently concluded from new observations that all coronal jets are driven by filament ejection, just like large mass ejections. This suggests that the two phenomena have physically identical origin and hence that a single mechanism may be responsible, that is, either mass ejections arise from reconnection, or jets arise from an ideal instability. Here we report simulations of a coronal jet driven by filament ejection, whereby a region of highly sheared magnetic field near the solar surface becomes unstable and erupts. The results show that magnetic reconnection causes the energy release via ‘magnetic breakout’—a positive-feedback mechanism between filament ejection and reconnection. We conclude that if coronal mass ejections and jets are indeed of physically identical origin (although on different spatial scales) then magnetic reconnection (rather than an ideal process) must also underlie mass ejections, and that magnetic breakout is a universal model for solar eruptions.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0335824228823185, 0.959219217300415, 0.0015435536624863744, 0.002736986381933093, 0.009033207781612873, 0.0013336982810869813, 0.0014923447743058205, 0.00020952617342118174]",0.0335824228823185,0.959219217300415,0.0015435536624863744,0.002736986381933093,0.009033207781612873,0.0013336982810869813,0.0014923447743058205,0.00020952617342118174

Most of our knowledge about stellar convection has come from studying the Sun: about two million convective cells with typical sizes of around 2,000 kilometres across are present on the surface of the Sun—a phenomenon known as granulation. But on the surfaces of giant and supergiant stars there should be only a few large (several tens of thousands of times larger than those on the Sun) convective cells, owing to low surface gravity. Deriving the characteristic properties of convection (such as granule size and contrast) for the most evolved giant and supergiant stars is challenging because their photospheres are obscured by dust, which partially masks the convective patterns. These properties can be inferred from geometric model fitting, but this indirect method does not provide information about the physical origin of the convective cells.

2018Natur.554..211A,Heliophysics,FALSE,Magnetic cage and rope as the key for solar eruptions,"Solar flares are spectacular coronal events that release large amounts of energy. They are classified as either eruptive or confined, depending on whether they are associated with a coronal mass ejection. Two types of model have been developed to identify the mechanism that triggers confined flares, although it has hitherto not been possible to decide between them because the magnetic field at the origin of the flares could not be determined with the required accuracy. In the first type of model, the triggering is related to the topological complexity of the flaring structure, which implies the presence of magnetically singular surfaces. This picture is observationally supported by the fact that radiative emission occurs near these features in many flaring regions. The second type of model attributes a key role to the formation of a twisted flux rope, which becomes unstable. Its plausibility is supported by simulations, by interpretations of some observations and by laboratory experiments. Here we report modelling of a confined event that uses the measured photospheric magnetic field as input. We first use a static model to compute the slowly evolving magnetic state of the corona before the eruption, and then use a dynamical model to determine the evolution during the eruption itself. We find that a magnetic flux rope must be present throughout the entire event to match the field measurements. This rope evolves slowly before saturating and suddenly erupting. Its energy is insufficient to break through the overlying field, whose lines form a confining cage, but its twist is large enough to trigger a kink instability, leading to the confined flare, as previously suggested. Topology is not the main cause of the flare, but it traces out the locations of the X-ray emission. We show that a weaker magnetic cage would have produced a more energetic eruption with a coronal mass ejection, associated with a predicted energy upper bound for a given region.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.009987916797399521, 0.9822875261306763, 0.0015969382366165519, 0.004078209865838289, 0.006259925197809935, 0.001459811581298709, 0.0012329374440014362, 0.00023218931164592505]",0.009987916797399521,0.9822875261306763,0.0015969382366165519,0.004078209865838289,0.006259925197809935,0.001459811581298709,0.0012329374440014362,0.00023218931164592505

Here we demonstrate evaporative cooling of a three-dimensional gas of fermionic sodium-potassium molecules to well below the Fermi temperature using microwave shielding. The molecules are protected from reaching short range with a repulsive barrier engineered by coupling rotational states with a blue-detuned circularly polarized microwave. The microwave dressing induces strong tunable dipolar interactions between the molecules, leading to high elastic collision rates that can exceed the inelastic ones by at least a factor of 460. This large elastic-to-inelastic collision ratio allows us to cool the molecular gas to 21 nanokelvin, corresponding to 0.36 times the Fermi temperature.

2018Natur.555..507S,Planetary Science,Astronomy,Isotopic evolution of the protoplanetary disk and the building blocks of Earth and the Moon,"Nucleosynthetic isotope variability among Solar System objects is often used to probe the genetic relationship between meteorite groups and the rocky planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars), which, in turn, may provide insights into the building blocks of the Earth-Moon system. Using this approach, it has been inferred that no primitive meteorite matches the terrestrial composition and the protoplanetary disk material from which Earth and the Moon accreted is therefore largely unconstrained. This conclusion, however, is based on the assumption that the observed nucleosynthetic variability of inner-Solar-System objects predominantly reflects spatial heterogeneity. Here we use the isotopic composition of the refractory element calcium to show that the nucleosynthetic variability in the inner Solar System primarily reflects a rapid change in the mass-independent calcium isotope composition of protoplanetary disk solids associated with early mass accretion to the proto-Sun. We measure the mass-independent <SUP>48</SUP>Ca/<SUP>44</SUP>Ca ratios of samples originating from the parent bodies of ureilite and angrite meteorites, as well as from Vesta, Mars and Earth, and find that they are positively correlated with the masses of their parent asteroids and planets, which are a proxy of their accretion timescales. This correlation implies a secular evolution of the bulk calcium isotope composition of the protoplanetary disk in the terrestrial planet-forming region. Individual chondrules from ordinary chondrites formed within one million years of the collapse of the proto-Sun reveal the full range of inner-Solar-System mass-independent <SUP>48</SUP>Ca/<SUP>44</SUP>Ca ratios, indicating a rapid change in the composition of the material of the protoplanetary disk. We infer that this secular evolution reflects admixing of pristine outer-Solar-System material into the thermally processed inner protoplanetary disk associated with the accretion of mass to the proto-Sun. The identical calcium isotope composition of Earth and the Moon reported here is a prediction of our model if the Moon-forming impact involved protoplanets or precursors that completed their accretion near the end of the protoplanetary disk’s lifetime.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.1507551670074463, 0.013257309794425964, 0.7217206358909607, 0.044847067445516586, 0.10452418029308319, 0.0008923221612349153, 0.0012739786179736257, 0.000529634184204042]",0.1507551670074463,0.013257309794425964,0.7217206358909607,0.044847067445516586,0.10452418029308319,0.0008923221612349153,0.0012739786179736257,0.000529634184204042

Ten years later, and with the data corresponding to the production of a 30-times larger number of Higgs bosons, we have learnt much more about the properties of the Higgs boson. The CMS experiment has observed the Higgs boson in numerous fermionic and bosonic decay channels, established its spin-parity quantum numbers, determined its mass and measured its production cross-sections in various modes. Here the CMS Collaboration reports the most up-to-date combination of results on the properties of the Higgs boson, including the most stringent limit on the cross-section for the production of a pair of Higgs bosons, on the basis of data from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 teraelectronvolts. Within the uncertainties, all these observations are compatible with the predictions of the standard model of elementary particle physics. Much evidence points to the fact that the standard model is a low-energy approximation of a more comprehensive theory. Several of the standard model issues originate in the sector of Higgs boson physics. An order of magnitude larger number of Higgs bosons, expected to be examined over the next 15 years, will help deepen our understanding of this crucial sector.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.09244083613157272, 0.002121592639014125, 0.005473727360367775, 0.006316659972071648, 0.015883387997746468, 0.8806591629981995, 0.0007539762300439179, 0.000448454957222566]",0.09244083613157272,0.002121592639014125,0.005473727360367775,0.006316659972071648,0.015883387997746468,0.8806591629981995,0.0007539762300439179,0.000448454957222566

2018Natur.555..216A,Planetary Science,FALSE,Clusters of cyclones encircling Jupiter’s poles,"The familiar axisymmetric zones and belts that characterize Jupiter’s weather system at lower latitudes give way to pervasive cyclonic activity at higher latitudes. Two-dimensional turbulence in combination with the Coriolis β-effect (that is, the large meridionally varying Coriolis force on the giant planets of the Solar System) produces alternating zonal flows. The zonal flows weaken with rising latitude so that a transition between equatorial jets and polar turbulence on Jupiter can occur. Simulations with shallow-water models of giant planets support this transition by producing both alternating flows near the equator and circumpolar cyclones near the poles. Jovian polar regions are not visible from Earth owing to Jupiter’s low axial tilt, and were poorly characterized by previous missions because the trajectories of these missions did not venture far from Jupiter’s equatorial plane. Here we report that visible and infrared images obtained from above each pole by the Juno spacecraft during its first five orbits reveal persistent polygonal patterns of large cyclones. In the north, eight circumpolar cyclones are observed about a single polar cyclone; in the south, one polar cyclone is encircled by five circumpolar cyclones. Cyclonic circulation is established via time-lapse imagery obtained over intervals ranging from 20 minutes to 4 hours. Although migration of cyclones towards the pole might be expected as a consequence of the Coriolis β-effect, by which cyclonic vortices naturally drift towards the rotational pole, the configuration of the cyclones is without precedent on other planets (including Saturn’s polar hexagonal features). The manner in which the cyclones persist without merging and the process by which they evolve to their current configuration are unknown.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0065448652021586895, 0.011247031390666962, 0.9519016742706299, 0.009500343352556229, 0.01907004602253437, 0.0005908097955398262, 0.0011933117639273405, 0.00025219994131475687]",0.0065448652021586895,0.011247031390666962,0.9519016742706299,0.009500343352556229,0.01907004602253437,0.0005908097955398262,0.0011933117639273405,0.00025219994131475687

2017Natur.549..511H,Planetary Science,Astronomy,Magnesium isotope evidence that accretional vapour loss shapes planetary compositions,"It has long been recognized that Earth and other differentiated planetary bodies are chemically fractionated compared to primitive, chondritic meteorites and, by inference, the primordial disk from which they formed. However, it is not known whether the notable volatile depletions of planetary bodies are a consequence of accretion or inherited from prior nebular fractionation. The isotopic compositions of the main constituents of planetary bodies can contribute to this debate. Here we develop an analytical approach that corrects a major cause of measurement inaccuracy inherent in conventional methods, and show that all differentiated bodies have isotopically heavier magnesium compositions than chondritic meteorites. We argue that possible magnesium isotope fractionation during condensation of the solar nebula, core formation and silicate differentiation cannot explain these observations. However, isotopic fractionation between liquid and vapour, followed by vapour escape during accretionary growth of planetesimals, generates appropriate residual compositions. Our modelling implies that the isotopic compositions of magnesium, silicon and iron, and the relative abundances of the major elements of Earth and other planetary bodies, are a natural consequence of substantial (about 40 per cent by mass) vapour loss from growing planetesimals by this mechanism.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.006733160465955734, 0.0045578074641525745, 0.9613767266273499, 0.031623512506484985, 0.019268758594989777, 0.0005298399482853711, 0.0020755294244736433, 0.000360269274096936]",0.006733160465955734,0.0045578074641525745,0.9613767266273499,0.031623512506484985,0.019268758594989777,0.0005298399482853711,0.0020755294244736433,0.000360269274096936
2017Natur.548..310O,Heliophysics,Astronomy,Vigorous atmospheric motion in the red supergiant star Antares,"Red supergiant stars represent a late stage of the evolution of stars more massive than about nine solar masses, in which they develop complex, multi-component atmospheres. Bright spots have been detected in the atmosphere of red supergiants using interferometric imaging. Above the photosphere of a red supergiant, the molecular outer atmosphere extends up to about two stellar radii. Furthermore, the hot chromosphere (5,000 to 8,000 kelvin) and cool gas (less than 3,500 kelvin) of a red supergiant coexist at about three stellar radii. The dynamics of such complex atmospheres has been probed by ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy. The most direct approach, however, is to measure the velocity of gas at each position over the image of stars as in observations of the Sun. Here we report the mapping of the velocity field over the surface and atmosphere of the nearby red supergiant Antares. The two-dimensional velocity field map obtained from our near-infrared spectro-interferometric imaging reveals vigorous upwelling and downdrafting motions of several huge gas clumps at velocities ranging from about -20 to +20 kilometres per second in the atmosphere, which extends out to about 1.7 stellar radii. Convection alone cannot explain the observed turbulent motions and atmospheric extension, suggesting that an unidentified process is operating in the extended atmosphere.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.700930655002594, 0.16743047535419464, 0.013519825413823128, 0.007414494641125202, 0.03497232124209404, 0.0005196953425183892, 0.000671005342155695, 0.00020781213243026286]",0.700930655002594,0.16743047535419464,0.013519825413823128,0.007414494641125202,0.03497232124209404,0.0005196953425183892,0.000671005342155695,0.00020781213243026286

We present paleomagnetic analyses of volcanic angrites demonstrating that they formed in a near-zero magnetic field (&lt;0.6 microtesla) at 4563.5 ± 0.1 million years ago, ~3.8 million years after solar system formation. This indicates that the solar nebula field, and likely the nebular gas, had dispersed by this time. This sets the time scale for formation of the gas giants and planet migration. Furthermore, it supports formation of chondrules after 4563.5 million years ago by non-nebular processes like planetesimal collisions.

2017Natur.541..525F,Planetary Science,Astronomy,Ruthenium isotopic evidence for an inner Solar System origin of the late veneer,"The excess of highly siderophile elements in the Earth’s mantle is thought to reflect the addition of primitive meteoritic material after core formation ceased. This ‘late veneer’ either comprises material remaining in the terrestrial planet region after the main stages of the Earth’s accretion, or derives from more distant asteroidal or cometary sources. Distinguishing between these disparate origins is important because a late veneer consisting of carbonaceous chondrite-like asteroids or comets could be the principal source of the Earth’s volatiles and water. Until now, however, a ‘genetic’ link between the late veneer and such volatile-rich materials has not been established or ruled out. Such genetic links can be determined using ruthenium (Ru) isotopes, because the Ru in the Earth’s mantle predominantly derives from the late veneer, and because meteorites exhibit Ru isotope variations arising from the heterogeneous distribution of stellar-derived dust. Although Ru isotopic data and the correlation of Ru and molybdenum (Mo) isotope anomalies in meteorites were previously used to argue that the late veneer derives from the same type of inner Solar System material as do Earth’s main building blocks, the Ru isotopic composition of carbonaceous chondrites has not been determined sufficiently well to rule them out as a source of the late veneer. Here we show that all chondrites, including carbonaceous chondrites, have Ru isotopic compositions distinct from that of the Earth’s mantle. The Ru isotope anomalies increase from enstatite to ordinary to carbonaceous chondrites, demonstrating that material formed at greater heliocentric distance contains larger Ru isotope anomalies. Therefore, these data refute an outer Solar System origin for the late veneer and imply that the late veneer was not the primary source of volatiles and water on the Earth.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.008487971499562263, 0.008626624941825867, 0.8286839723587036, 0.07766066491603851, 0.02634500339627266, 0.0004558713408187032, 0.0007802121108397841, 0.0002052425843430683]",0.008487971499562263,0.008626624941825867,0.8286839723587036,0.07766066491603851,0.02634500339627266,0.0004558713408187032,0.0007802121108397841,0.0002052425843430683

Reorientation of Sputnik Planitia arising from tidal and rotational torques can explain the basin’s present-day location, but requires the feature to be a positive gravity anomaly, despite its negative topography. Here we argue that if Sputnik Planitia did indeed form as a result of an impact and if Pluto possesses a subsurface ocean, the required positive gravity anomaly would naturally result because of shell thinning and ocean uplift, followed by later modest nitrogen deposition. Without a subsurface ocean, a positive gravity anomaly requires an implausibly thick nitrogen layer (exceeding 40 kilometres). To prolong the lifetime of such a subsurface ocean to the present day and to maintain ocean uplift, a rigid, conductive water-ice shell is required. Because nitrogen deposition is latitude-dependent, nitrogen loading and reorientation may have exhibited complex feedbacks.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.003513199044391513, 0.0013972490560263395, 0.9891632795333862, 0.011214541271328926, 0.0073166596703231335, 0.0011244418565183878, 0.0026437516789883375, 0.00033217965392395854]",0.003513199044391513,0.0013972490560263395,0.9891632795333862,0.011214541271328926,0.0073166596703231335,0.0011244418565183878,0.0026437516789883375,0.00033217965392395854

2018Natur.558..586B,Planetary Science,FALSE,Evidence for extremely rapid magma ocean crystallization and crust formation on Mars,"The formation of a primordial crust is a critical step in the evolution of terrestrial planets but the timing of this process is poorly understood. The mineral zircon is a powerful tool for constraining crust formation because it can be accurately dated with the uranium-to-lead (U-Pb) isotopic decay system and is resistant to subsequent alteration. Moreover, given the high concentration of hafnium in zircon, the lutetium-to-hafnium (176Lu-176Hf) isotopic decay system can be used to determine the nature and formation timescale of its source reservoir. Ancient igneous zircons with crystallization ages of around 4,430 million years (Myr) have been reported in Martian meteorites that are believed to represent regolith breccias from the southern highlands of Mars. These zircons are present in evolved lithologies interpreted to reflect re-melted primary Martian crust, thereby potentially providing insight into early crustal evolution on Mars. Here, we report concomitant high-precision U-Pb ages and Hf-isotope compositions of ancient zircons from the NWA 7034 Martian regolith breccia. Seven zircons with mostly concordant U-Pb ages define 207Pb/206Pb dates ranging from 4,476.3 ± 0.9 Myr ago to 4,429.7 ± 1.0 Myr ago, including the oldest directly dated material from Mars. All zircons record unradiogenic initial Hf-isotope compositions inherited from an enriched, andesitic-like crust extracted from a primitive mantle no later than 4,547 Myr ago. Thus, a primordial crust existed on Mars by this time and survived for around 100 Myr before it was reworked, possibly by impacts, to produce magmas from which the zircons crystallized. Given that formation of a stable primordial crust is the end product of planetary differentiation, our data require that the accretion, core formation and magma ocean crystallization on Mars were completed less than 20 Myr after the formation of the Solar System. These timescales support models that suggest extremely rapid magma ocean crystallization leading to a gravitationally unstable stratified mantle, which subsequently overturns, resulting in decompression melting of rising cumulates and production of a primordial basaltic to andesitic crust.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.00388661352917552, 0.003911214414983988, 0.240020751953125, 0.8429785966873169, 0.01536677684634924, 0.00029152343631722033, 0.0010311385849490762, 0.00021255004685372114]",0.00388661352917552,0.003911214414983988,0.240020751953125,0.8429785966873169,0.01536677684634924,0.00029152343631722033,0.0010311385849490762,0.00021255004685372114

Recent observations have shown it to be much colder than predicted theoretically, suggesting an unknown cooling mechanism. Atmospheric gas molecules, particularly water vapour, have been proposed as a coolant; however, because Pluto’s thermal structure is expected to be in radiative-conductive equilibrium, the required water vapour would need to be supersaturated by many orders of magnitude under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions. Here we report that atmospheric hazes, rather than gases, can explain Pluto’s temperature profile. We find that haze particles have substantially larger solar heating and thermal cooling rates than gas molecules, dominating the atmospheric radiative balance from the ground to an altitude of 700 kilometres, above which heat conduction maintains an isothermal atmosphere. We conclude that Pluto’s atmosphere is unique among Solar System planetary atmospheres, as its radiative energy equilibrium is controlled primarily by haze particles instead of gas molecules.

The high-energy emission comes from the original fragment material and is heavily absorbed by optically thick plasma, possibly explaining the lower mass accretion rates inferred from x-rays relative to UV-optical-near infrared observations of young stars.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.8384109735488892, 0.11187486350536346, 0.022938938811421394, 0.00339332758449018, 0.031155966222286224, 0.0004667901957873255, 0.000574645702727139, 0.00021353868942242116]",0.8384109735488892,0.11187486350536346,0.022938938811421394,0.00339332758449018,0.031155966222286224,0.0004667901957873255,0.000574645702727139,0.00021353868942242116

Here we develop a high-fidelity parameterizable fSim gate and implement the periodic quantum circuit of the spin-½ XXZ model in a ring of 24 superconducting qubits. We study the propagation of these excitations and observe their bound nature for up to five photons. We devise a phase-sensitive method for constructing the few-body spectrum of the bound states and extract their pseudo-charge by introducing a synthetic flux. By introducing interactions between the ring and additional qubits, we observe an unexpected resilience of the bound states to integrability breaking. This finding goes against the idea that bound states in non-integrable systems are unstable when their energies overlap with the continuum spectrum. Our work provides experimental evidence for bound states of interacting photons and discovers their stability beyond the integrability limit.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.002905147382989526, 0.002300018211826682, 0.0019611527677625418, 0.002014913596212864, 0.002169139450415969, 0.9957593083381653, 0.0029059776570647955, 0.00038473380845971406]",0.002905147382989526,0.002300018211826682,0.0019611527677625418,0.002014913596212864,0.002169139450415969,0.9957593083381653,0.0029059776570647955,0.00038473380845971406

In a subset of the asteroids called main-belt comets, the sublimation of excavated volatiles causes transient comet-like activity. Torques exerted by sublimation measurably influence the spin rates of active comets and might lead to the splitting of bilobate comet nuclei. The kilometre-sized main-belt asteroid 288P (300163) showed activity for several months around its perihelion 2011 (ref. 11), suspected to be sustained by the sublimation of water ice and supported by rapid rotation, while at least one component rotates slowly with a period of 16 hours (ref. 14). The object 288P is part of a young family of at least 11 asteroids that formed from a precursor about 10 kilometres in diameter during a shattering collision 7.5 million years ago. Here we report that 288P is a binary main-belt comet. It is different from the known asteroid binaries in its combination of wide separation, near-equal component size, high eccentricity and comet-like activity.

2018Natur.561..206T,Heliophysics,FALSE,Autogenous and efficient acceleration of energetic ions upstream of Earth's bow shock,"Earth and its magnetosphere are immersed in the supersonic flow of the solar-wind plasma that fills interplanetary space. As the solar wind slows and deflects to flow around Earth, or any other obstacle, a `bow shock' forms within the flow. Under almost all solar-wind conditions, planetary bow shocks such as Earth's are collisionless, supercritical shocks, meaning that they reflect and accelerate a fraction of the incident solar-wind ions as an energy dissipation mechanism<SUP>1,2</SUP>, which results in the formation of a region called the ion foreshock<SUP>3</SUP>. In the foreshock, large-scale, transient phenomena can develop, such as `hot flow anomalies'<SUP>4-9</SUP>, which are concentrations of shock-reflected, suprathermal ions that are channelled and accumulated along certain structures in the upstream magnetic field. Hot flow anomalies evolve explosively, often resulting in the formation of new shocks along their upstream edges<SUP>5,10</SUP>, and potentially contribute to particle acceleration<SUP>11-13</SUP>, but there have hitherto been no observations to constrain this acceleration or to confirm the underlying mechanism. Here we report observations of a hot flow anomaly accelerating solar-wind ions from roughly 1-10 kiloelectronvolts up to almost 1,000 kiloelectronvolts. The acceleration mechanism depends on the mass and charge state of the ions and is consistent with first-order Fermi acceleration<SUP>14,15</SUP>. The acceleration that we observe results from only the interaction of Earth's bow shock with the solar wind, but produces a much, much larger number of energetic particles compared to what would typically be produced in the foreshock from acceleration at the bow shock. Such autogenous and efficient acceleration at quasi-parallel bow shocks (the normal direction of which are within about 45 degrees of the interplanetary magnetic field direction) provides a potential solution to Fermi's `injection problem', which requires an as-yet-unexplained seed population of energetic particles, and implies that foreshock transients may be important in the generation of cosmic rays at astrophysical shocks throughout the cosmos.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.008286588825285435, 0.862208366394043, 0.35296276211738586, 0.0014463423285633326, 0.017256688326597214, 0.0018138022860512137, 0.0005861024837940931, 0.0002749711857177317]",0.008286588825285435,0.862208366394043,0.35296276211738586,0.0014463423285633326,0.017256688326597214,0.0018138022860512137,0.0005861024837940931,0.0002749711857177317

Combining birefringence and second-harmonic-generation measurements with theoretical modelling and simulations, we detect a highly anisotropic electronic state that simultaneously breaks three-fold rotational and inversion symmetry, and supports polar order.

2016Natur.540...97H,Planetary Science,FALSE,The rapid formation of Sputnik Planitia early in Pluto's history,"Pluto's Sputnik Planitia is a bright, roughly circular feature that resembles a polar ice cap. It is approximately 1,000 kilometres across and is centred on a latitude of 25 degrees north and a longitude of 175 degrees, almost directly opposite the side of Pluto that always faces Charon as a result of tidal locking. One explanation for its location includes the formation of a basin in a giant impact, with subsequent upwelling of a dense interior ocean. Once the basin was established, ice would naturally have accumulated there. Then, provided that the basin was a positive gravity anomaly (with or without the ocean), true polar wander could have moved the feature towards the Pluto-Charon tidal axis, on the far side of Pluto from Charon. Here we report modelling that shows that ice quickly accumulates on Pluto near latitudes of 30 degrees north and south, even in the absence of a basin, because, averaged over its orbital period, those are Pluto's coldest regions. Within a million years of Charon's formation, ice deposits on Pluto concentrate into a single cap centred near a latitude of 30 degrees, owing to the runaway albedo effect. This accumulation of ice causes a positive gravity signature that locks, as Pluto's rotation slows, to a longitude directly opposite Charon. Once locked, Charon raises a permanent tidal bulge on Pluto, which greatly enhances the gravity signature of the ice cap. Meanwhile, the weight of the ice in Sputnik Planitia causes the crust under it to slump, creating its own basin (as has happened on Earth in Greenland).

Here, we use single-electron-transistor imaging of electronic flow in high-mobility graphene Corbino disk devices to answer this question. First, by imaging ballistic flows at liquid-helium temperatures, we observe a Landauer-Sharvin resistance that does not appear at the contacts but is instead distributed throughout the bulk. This underpins the phase-space origin of this resistance—as emerging from spatial gradients in the number of conduction modes. At elevated temperatures, by identifying and accounting for electron-phonon scattering, we show the details of the purely hydrodynamic flow. Strikingly, we find that electron hydrodynamics eliminates the bulk Landauer-Sharvin resistance. Finally, by imaging spiralling magneto-hydrodynamic Corbino flows, we show the key emergent length scale predicted by hydrodynamic theories—the Gurzhi length. These observations demonstrate that electronic fluids can dramatically transcend the fundamental limitations of ballistic electrons, with important implications for fundamental science and future technologies.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0020707794465124607, 0.0013861226616427302, 0.001566998427733779, 0.0017474772175773978, 0.0016566962003707886, 0.9917085766792297, 0.00865058321505785, 0.00030527179478667676]",0.0020707794465124607,0.0013861226616427302,0.001566998427733779,0.0017474772175773978,0.0016566962003707886,0.9917085766792297,0.00865058321505785,0.00030527179478667676

Although macrophage differentiation favors short-patch base excision repair to fill in single-nucleotide gaps, neurons also frequently use the long-patch subpathway.

Our observations may open up new avenues for light manipulation and state conversion, as well as providing a foundation for understanding the intricacies of the adiabatic theorem in non-Hermitian systems.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.002469524974003434, 0.00195366982370615, 0.001648979727178812, 0.002031368901953101, 0.0018968459917232394, 0.9948105812072754, 0.004314872436225414, 0.00034379176213406026]",0.002469524974003434,0.00195366982370615,0.001648979727178812,0.002031368901953101,0.0018968459917232394,0.9948105812072754,0.004314872436225414,0.00034379176213406026

Homo evolved in the savannas 2 million years ago (Ma), and agricultural societies arose through the domestication of grasses, such as wheat and barley, 10,000 years ago. These grass crops, as well as corn and rice, remain dominant staple foods globally (1). Livestock production also centers in areas that were once (and sometimes still are) native grasslands. Grassy biomes harbor distinct and diverse sets of plants and animals that have adapted to these environments through millions of years of evolution (2). As the biodiversity and economic prominence of grassy biomes are increasingly being recognized, there is a demand for better understanding of their past and present function to inform policy and management.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0015059550059959292, 0.0012342857662588358, 0.009948552586138248, 0.9582167863845825, 0.009800992906093597, 0.000909724913071841, 0.0065878648310899734, 0.000227929835091345]",0.0015059550059959292,0.0012342857662588358,0.009948552586138248,0.9582167863845825,0.009800992906093597,0.000909724913071841,0.0065878648310899734,0.000227929835091345

How activated microglia selectively enhance the activity of spinal nociceptive circuits is not well understood. We discovered that after peripheral nerve injury, microglia degrade extracellular matrix structures, perineuronal nets (PNNs), in lamina I of the spinal cord dorsal horn. Lamina I PNNs selectively enwrap spinoparabrachial projection neurons, which integrate nociceptive information in the spinal cord and convey it to supraspinal brain regions to induce pain sensation. Degradation of PNNs by microglia enhances the activity of projection neurons and induces pain-related behaviors. Thus, nerve injury–induced degradation of PNNs is a mechanism by which microglia selectively augment the output of spinal nociceptive circuits and cause pain hypersensitivity.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.002002828987315297, 0.0026155367959290743, 0.0022905280347913504, 0.0026121579576283693, 0.0016339569119736552, 0.0027426420710980892, 0.9945953488349915, 0.00046010586083866656]",0.002002828987315297,0.0026155367959290743,0.0022905280347913504,0.0026121579576283693,0.0016339569119736552,0.0027426420710980892,0.9945953488349915,0.00046010586083866656

We show here that the earliest known COVID-19 cases from December 2019, including those without reported direct links, were geographically centered on this market. We report that live SARS-CoV-2–susceptible mammals were sold at the market in late 2019 and that within the market, SARS-CoV-2–positive environmental samples were spatially associated with vendors selling live mammals. Although there is insufficient evidence to define upstream events, and exact circumstances remain obscure, our analyses indicate that the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 occurred through the live wildlife trade in China and show that the Huanan market was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0023617888800799847, 0.0003360071568749845, 0.0020974213257431984, 0.1437048316001892, 0.003112304490059614, 0.001656584208831191, 0.8619064688682556, 0.00014873250620439649]",0.0023617888800799847,0.0003360071568749845,0.0020974213257431984,0.1437048316001892,0.003112304490059614,0.001656584208831191,0.8619064688682556,0.00014873250620439649

Until now, data limitations have made it difficult to monitor the growth and retreat cycles of ice shelves on a large scale, and the full impact of recent calving-front changes on ice-shelf buttressing has not been understood. Here, by combining data from multiple optical and radar satellite sensors, we generate pan-Antarctic, spatially continuous coastlines at roughly annual resolution since 1997. We show that from 1997 to 2021, Antarctica experienced a net loss of 36,701 ± 1,465 square kilometres (1.9 per cent) of ice-shelf area that cannot be fully regained before the next series of major calving events, which are likely to occur in the next decade. Mass loss associated with ice-front retreat (5,874 ± 396 gigatonnes) has been approximately equal to mass change owing to ice-shelf thinning over the past quarter of a century (6,113 ± 452 gigatonnes), meaning that the total mass loss is nearly double that which could be measured by altimetry-based surveys alone. We model the impacts of Antarctica's recent coastline evolution in the absence of additional feedbacks, and find that calving and thinning have produced equivalent reductions in ice-shelf buttressing since 2007, and that further retreat could produce increasingly significant sea-level rise in the future.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0025559086352586746, 0.0011929384199902415, 0.004918408580124378, 0.9864025712013245, 0.006680378690361977, 0.0011531360214576125, 0.0028902720659971237, 0.00024874706286937]",0.0025559086352586746,0.0011929384199902415,0.004918408580124378,0.9864025712013245,0.006680378690361977,0.0011531360214576125,0.0028902720659971237,0.00024874706286937

Fatigue can cause failure even if the loads did not result in any macroscopic deformation. This behavior is known to be sensitive to the tiniest defects in the material; hence, an accurate prediction of fatigue failure remains elusive. On page 1065 of this issue, Stinville et al.

In the high–nodule energy state, GmNAS1 and GmNAP1 form homodimers that interact with the nuclear factor-Y C (NF-YC) subunit (GmNFYC10a) on mitochondria and reduce its nuclear accumulation. Less nuclear GmNFYC10a leads to lower expression of glycolytic genes involved in pyruvate production, which modulates phosphoenolpyruvate allocation to favor nitrogen fixation. Insight into these pathways may help in the design of leguminous crops that have improved carbon use, nitrogen fixation, and growth.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.002137357834726572, 0.002204599091783166, 0.0021631945855915546, 0.0031528521794825792, 0.0016942023066803813, 0.0024575700517743826, 0.9945563077926636, 0.00041104695992544293]",0.002137357834726572,0.002204599091783166,0.0021631945855915546,0.0031528521794825792,0.0016942023066803813,0.0024575700517743826,0.9945563077926636,0.00041104695992544293

We combine measurements made by the four spacecraft of the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission to demonstrate how the plasma and magnetic forces at the boundary affect the interaction between the shocked solar wind and Earth’s magnetosphere. We compare these forces with the plasma pressure and examine the electron distribution function. We find that the magnetopause has sublayers with thickness comparable to the ion scale. Small pockets of low magnetic field strength, small radius of curvature, and high electric current mark the electron diffusion region.

We develop trait-based models to predict pairwise interactions and dispersal function for fleshy-fruited plants globally. Using interactions with introduced species as an observable proxy for interactions in future novel seed dispersal networks, we find strong potential to forecast their assembly and functioning. We conservatively estimate that mammal and bird defaunation has already reduced the capacity of plants to track climate change by 60% globally. This strong reduction in the ability of plants to adapt to climate change through range shifts shows a synergy between defaunation and climate change that undermines vegetation resilience.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0020574694499373436, 0.0003581828495953232, 0.0022214085329324007, 0.48450884222984314, 0.005606611259281635, 0.0017798879416659474, 0.5212770700454712, 0.00015489387442357838]",0.0020574694499373436,0.0003581828495953232,0.0022214085329324007,0.48450884222984314,0.005606611259281635,0.0017798879416659474,0.5212770700454712,0.00015489387442357838

Our results open the door to new device concepts of high-performance organic electronics with ever faster switching speeds.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.001720571774058044, 0.0006543223280459642, 0.0013411421095952392, 0.0017951627960428596, 0.0018193463329225779, 0.5305215716362, 0.6873462796211243, 0.00024408266472164541]",0.001720571774058044,0.0006543223280459642,0.0013411421095952392,0.0017951627960428596,0.0018193463329225779,0.5305215716362,0.6873462796211243,0.00024408266472164541
2022Natur.607..585S,Biology,FALSE,The gut metabolite indole-3 propionate promotes nerve regeneration and repair,"The regenerative potential of mammalian peripheral nervous system neurons after injury is critically limited by their slow axonal regenerative rate<SUP>1</SUP>. Regenerative ability is influenced by both injury-dependent and injury-independent mechanisms<SUP>2</SUP>. Among the latter, environmental factors such as exercise and environmental enrichment have been shown to affect signalling pathways that promote axonal regeneration<SUP>3</SUP>. Several of these pathways, including modifications in gene transcription and protein synthesis, mitochondrial metabolism and the release of neurotrophins, can be activated by intermittent fasting (IF)<SUP>4,5</SUP>. However, whether IF influences the axonal regenerative ability remains to be investigated. Here we show that IF promotes axonal regeneration after sciatic nerve crush in mice through an unexpected mechanism that relies on the gram-positive gut microbiome and an increase in the gut bacteria-derived metabolite indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) in the serum. IPA production by Clostridium sporogenes is required for efficient axonal regeneration, and delivery of IPA after sciatic injury significantly enhances axonal regeneration, accelerating the recovery of sensory function. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing analysis from sciatic dorsal root ganglia suggested a role for neutrophil chemotaxis in the IPA-dependent regenerative phenotype, which was confirmed by inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis. Our results demonstrate the ability of a microbiome-derived metabolite, such as IPA, to facilitate regeneration and functional recovery of sensory axons through an immune-mediated mechanism.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0020143326837569475, 0.001950772013515234, 0.0021678837947547436, 0.002631976967677474, 0.0016423198394477367, 0.0038343847263604403, 0.9936684966087341, 0.0003948717494495213]",0.0020143326837569475,0.001950772013515234,0.0021678837947547436,0.002631976967677474,0.0016423198394477367,0.0038343847263604403,0.9936684966087341,0.0003948717494495213

It endows Bloch electrons with transverse anomalous velocities to produce Hall-like currents even in the absence of a magnetic field. We report the direct observation of in situ tunable valley-selective Hall effect (VSHE), where inversion symmetry, and thus the geometric phase of electrons, is controllable by an out-of-plane electric field. We use high-quality bilayer graphene with an intrinsic and tunable bandgap, illuminated by circularly polarized midinfrared light, and confirm that the observed Hall voltage arises from an optically induced valley population. Compared with molybdenum disulfide (MoS<SUB>2</SUB>), we find orders of magnitude larger VSHE, attributed to the inverse scaling of the Berry curvature with bandgap. By monitoring the valley-selective Hall conductivity, we study the Berry curvature’s evolution with bandgap.

To understand speech evolution, we examined a wide range of primates, combining observations of phonation with mathematical modeling. We found that source stability relies upon simplifications in laryngeal anatomy, specifically the loss of air sacs and vocal membranes. We conclude that the evolutionary loss of vocal membranes allows human speech to mostly avoid the spontaneous nonlinear phenomena and acoustic chaos common in other primate vocalizations. This loss allows our larynx to produce stable, harmonic-rich phonation, ideally highlighting formant changes that convey most phonetic information. Paradoxically, the increased complexity of human spoken language thus followed simplification of our laryngeal anatomy.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0023501082323491573, 0.001746269641444087, 0.0019777552224695683, 0.0029236304108053446, 0.0017428566934540868, 0.0040283529087901115, 0.9939115047454834, 0.00039417826337739825]",0.0023501082323491573,0.001746269641444087,0.0019777552224695683,0.0029236304108053446,0.0017428566934540868,0.0040283529087901115,0.9939115047454834,0.00039417826337739825

Although correctly prescribing a susceptibility-matched antibiotic reduces recurrence rates overall, it also increases the chances of developing a resistant infection caused by a different strain. Thus, treatment is a double-edged sword, in which susceptibility-matched treatments can pave the way for resistant strains lurking in the microbiota.

Simultaneously, the environmental conditions within protected areas are changing because of shifting climates, pollution, and invasive species, which all fundamentally alter ecosystems globally. To effectively conserve biodiversity, researchers and policy-makers must critically reexamine both the lands being preserved and the protection strategies being used in conservation. On pages 1094 and 1101 of this issue, Allan et al. (3) and Brennan et al. (4), respectively, evaluate the preservation capacity of today’s protected areas in different but complementary ways. Allan et al. estimate the minimum land area necessary to support today’s terrestrial biodiversity, whereas Brennan et al. identify the connectedness necessary to allow wildlife to successfully adapt to global change.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.00853700190782547, 0.0019006985239684582, 0.07229242473840714, 0.5239747762680054, 0.03878944367170334, 0.0006080087041482329, 0.09295967221260071, 0.000402721663704142]",0.00853700190782547,0.0019006985239684582,0.07229242473840714,0.5239747762680054,0.03878944367170334,0.0006080087041482329,0.09295967221260071,0.000402721663704142

Even young people with mild initial disease can develop acute COVID-19 and Long Covid neuropsychiatric syndromes. The pathophysiological mechanisms are not well understood, although evidence primarily implicates immune dysfunction, including nonspecific neuroinflammation and antineural autoimmune dysregulation. It is uncertain whether unforeseen neurological consequences may develop years after initial infection. With millions of individuals affected, nervous system complications pose public health challenges for rehabilitation and recovery and for disruptions in the workforce due to loss of functional capacity.

Here we bioengineered the same change into soybean. In replicated field trials, photosynthetic efficiency in fluctuating light was higher and seed yield in five independent transformation events increased by up to 33%. Despite increased seed quantity, seed protein and oil content were unaltered. This validates increasing photosynthetic efficiency as a much needed strategy toward sustainably increasing crop yield in support of future global food security.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0016690990887582302, 0.0013064088998362422, 0.0016326125478371978, 0.010398996993899345, 0.0018808230524882674, 0.0020579551346600056, 0.9879137873649597, 0.00023498926020693034]",0.0016690990887582302,0.0013064088998362422,0.0016326125478371978,0.010398996993899345,0.0018808230524882674,0.0020579551346600056,0.9879137873649597,0.00023498926020693034

Upon rechallenge, these “trained” ILC3s proliferate, display enhanced interleukin-22 (IL-22) responses, and have a superior capacity to control infection compared with naïve ILC3s. Metabolic changes occur in C. rodentium–exposed ILC3s, but only trained ILC3s have an enhanced proliferative capacity that contributes to increased IL-22 production.

The pharyngeal skeleton of controversial Cambrian animals called yunnanozoans may contain the oldest fossil evidence constraining the early evolution of the arches, yet its correlation with that of vertebrates is still disputed. By examining additional specimens in previously unexplored techniques (for example, x-ray microtomography, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectrometry element mapping), we found evidence that yunnanozoan branchial arches consist of cellular cartilage with an extracellular matrix dominated by microfibrils, a feature hitherto considered specific to vertebrates.

We attribute the overall increase in global diversity during the Late Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras to the development of diversity hotspots under prolonged conditions of Earth system stability and maximum continental fragmentation.

We show here that 30% CR was sufficient to extend the life span by 10%; however, a daily fasting interval and circadian alignment of feeding acted together to extend life span by 35% in male C57BL/6J mice.

Here, we identify opportunities associated with three scientific frontiers: understand the potential for effective climate risk reduction (including understanding maladaptation, residual risk, and adaptation limits); assess systemic, cascading, and transboundary risks; and track adaptation progress.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0014347279211506248, 0.0005892172339372337, 0.0011825585970655084, 0.4459966719150543, 0.007624575402587652, 0.0047797407023608685, 0.4765171408653259, 0.0001788709923857823]",0.0014347279211506248,0.0005892172339372337,0.0011825585970655084,0.4459966719150543,0.007624575402587652,0.0047797407023608685,0.4765171408653259,0.0001788709923857823
2022Sci...378.1214A,Biology,FALSE,The role of divergent ecological adaptation during allopatric speciation in vertebrates,"After decades of debate, biologists today largely agree that most speciation events require an allopatric phase (that is, geographic separation), but the role of adaptive ecological divergence during this critical period is still unknown. Here, we show that relatively few allopatric pairs of birds, mammals, or amphibians exhibit trait differences consistent with models of divergent adaptation in each of many ecologically relevant traits. By fitting new evolutionary models to numerous sets of sister-pair trait differences, we find that speciating and recently speciated allopatric taxa seem to overwhelmingly evolve under similar rather than divergent macro–selective pressures. This contradicts the classical view of divergent adaptation as a prominent driver of the early stages of speciation and helps synthesize two historical controversies regarding the ecology and geography of species formation.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0015215491876006126, 0.00029520245152525604, 0.0016776184784248471, 0.4959443509578705, 0.0025778887793421745, 0.0016865940997377038, 0.47553738951683044, 0.00012550578685477376]",0.0015215491876006126,0.00029520245152525604,0.0016776184784248471,0.4959443509578705,0.0025778887793421745,0.0016865940997377038,0.47553738951683044,0.00012550578685477376

Using cryo–electron microscopy and single–molecule imaging, we investigated how MAP7 binds MTs and facilitates kinesin-1 motility. The MT-binding domain (MTBD) of MAP7 bound MTs as an extended α helix between the protofilament ridge and the site of lateral contact. Unexpectedly, the MTBD partially overlapped with the binding site of kinesin-1 and inhibited its motility. However, by tethering kinesin-1 to the MT, the projection domain of MAP7 prevented dissociation of the motor and facilitated its binding to available neighboring sites. The inhibitory effect of the MTBD dominated as MTs became saturated with MAP7.

When tilting the magnetic field away from the hard axis such that the Ising symmetry is always broken, a line of well-defined phase transitions emerges from the TF-QCP, characteristic of further symmetry breaking, in stark contrast to a crossover expected microscopically. We show that the scenario of a continuous suppression of ferromagnetic domains, representing a breaking of translation symmetry on mesoscopic scales in an environment of broken magnetic Ising symmetry on microscopic scales, is in excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement with the field and temperature dependence of the susceptibility and the magnetic phase diagram of LiHoF<SUB>4</SUB> under tilted field. This identifies a new type of phase transition that may be referred to as mesoscale quantum criticality, which emanates from the textbook example of a microscopic ferromagnetic TF-QCP. Our results establish the surroundings of quantum phase transitions as a regime of mesoscale pattern formation, in which non-analytical quantum dynamics and materials properties without classical analogue may be expected.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0022608828730881214, 0.0019192630425095558, 0.001819662400521338, 0.0022918840404599905, 0.0018427592003718019, 0.9951733946800232, 0.003393867751583457, 0.0003438776475377381]",0.0022608828730881214,0.0019192630425095558,0.001819662400521338,0.0022918840404599905,0.0018427592003718019,0.9951733946800232,0.003393867751583457,0.0003438776475377381

A proposed model for this specificity is that promoters have sequence-encoded preferences for certain enhancers, for example, mediated by interacting sets of transcription factors or cofactors<SUP>2</SUP>. This `biochemical compatibility' model has been supported by observations at individual human promoters and by genome-wide measurements in Drosophila<SUP>3-9</SUP>. However, the degree to which human enhancers and promoters are intrinsically compatible has not yet been systematically measured, and how their activities combine to control RNA expression remains unclear. Here we design a high-throughput reporter assay called enhancer × promoter self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (ExP STARR-seq) and applied it to examine the combinatorial compatibilities of 1,000 enhancer and 1,000 promoter sequences in human K562 cells. We identify simple rules for enhancer-promoter compatibility, whereby most enhancers activate all promoters by similar amounts, and intrinsic enhancer and promoter activities multiplicatively combine to determine RNA output (R<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.82). In addition, two classes of enhancers and promoters show subtle preferential effects. Promoters of housekeeping genes contain built-in activating motifs for factors such as GABPA and YY1, which decrease the responsiveness of promoters to distal enhancers. Promoters of variably expressed genes lack these motifs and show stronger responsiveness to enhancers. Together, this systematic assessment of enhancer-promoter compatibility suggests a multiplicative model tuned by enhancer and promoter class to control gene transcription in the human genome.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0023969088215380907, 0.0017353921430185437, 0.0023185089230537415, 0.0024958932772278786, 0.0017383369849994779, 0.003913765773177147, 0.9938236474990845, 0.000403713173000142]",0.0023969088215380907,0.0017353921430185437,0.0023185089230537415,0.0024958932772278786,0.0017383369849994779,0.003913765773177147,0.9938236474990845,0.000403713173000142

Here we use cryogenic electron microscopy to solve four structures of the 6.2 MDa PBS, with and without OCP bound, from the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The structures contain a previously undescribed linker protein that binds to the membrane-facing side of PBS. For the unquenched PBS, the structures also reveal three different conformational states of the antenna, two previously unknown. The conformational states result from positional switching of two of the rods and may constitute a new mode of regulation of light harvesting. Only one of the three PBS conformations can bind to OCP, which suggests that not every PBS is equally susceptible to non-photochemical quenching. In the OCP-PBS complex, quenching is achieved through the binding of four 34 kDa OCPs organized as two dimers. The complex reveals the structure of the active form of OCP, in which an approximately 60 Å displacement of its regulatory carboxy terminal domain occurs.

However, how and where these states are generated remains poorly understood. Here, using the mouse somatosensory cortex, we demonstrate that microglia density and molecular state acquisition are determined by the local composition of pyramidal neuron classes. Using single-cell and spatial transcriptomic profiling, we unveil the molecular signatures and spatial distributions of diverse microglia populations and show that certain states are enriched in specific cortical layers, whereas others are broadly distributed throughout the cortex. Notably, conversion of deep-layer pyramidal neurons to an alternate class identity reconfigures the distribution of local, layer-enriched homeostatic microglia to match the new neuronal niche. Leveraging the transcriptional diversity of pyramidal neurons in the neocortex, we construct a ligand-receptor atlas describing interactions between individual pyramidal neuron subtypes and microglia states, revealing rules of neuron-microglia communication. Our findings uncover a fundamental role for neuronal diversity in instructing the acquisition of microglia states as a potential mechanism for fine-tuning neuroimmune interactions within the cortical local circuitry.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.001741744694299996, 0.0013720380375161767, 0.0015144078060984612, 0.0017720406176522374, 0.0014529222389683127, 0.017997179180383682, 0.9812703132629395, 0.00031190935987979174]",0.001741744694299996,0.0013720380375161767,0.0015144078060984612,0.0017720406176522374,0.0014529222389683127,0.017997179180383682,0.9812703132629395,0.00031190935987979174

Here we show that colibactin targets bacteria that contain prophages, and induces lytic development through the bacterial SOS response. DNA, added exogenously, protects bacteria from colibactin, as does expressing a colibactin resistance protein (ClbS) in non-colibactin-producing cells. The prophage-inducing effects that we observe apply broadly across different phage-bacteria systems and in complex communities. Finally, we identify bacteria that have colibactin resistance genes but lack colibactin biosynthetic genes. Many of these bacteria are infected with predicted prophages, and we show that the expression of their ClbS homologues provides immunity from colibactin-triggered induction. Our study reveals a mechanism by which colibactin production could affect microbiomes and highlights a role for microbial natural products in influencing population-level events such as phage outbreaks.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.001766453729942441, 0.0012080479646101594, 0.002179753500968218, 0.003532475559040904, 0.0017106093000620604, 0.005134691018611193, 0.9902128577232361, 0.0002927547902800143]",0.001766453729942441,0.0012080479646101594,0.002179753500968218,0.003532475559040904,0.0017106093000620604,0.005134691018611193,0.9902128577232361,0.0002927547902800143

Combining telomerase, a short telomeric ssDNA primer and CST-Polα-primase gives complete telomeric DNA replication, resulting in the same sort of ssDNA 3' overhang found naturally on human telomeres. We conclude that the CST complex not only terminates telomerase extension<SUP>10,11</SUP> and recruits Polα-primase to telomeric ssDNA<SUP>4,12,13</SUP> but also orchestrates C-strand synthesis. Because replication of the telomere has features distinct from replication of the rest of the genome, targeting telomere-replication components including CST holds promise for cancer therapeutics.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.002191409468650818, 0.0019164225086569786, 0.0021231439895927906, 0.0025468585081398487, 0.0016826045466586947, 0.003996464889496565, 0.9937601685523987, 0.0004070295253768563]",0.002191409468650818,0.0019164225086569786,0.0021231439895927906,0.0025468585081398487,0.0016826045466586947,0.003996464889496565,0.9937601685523987,0.0004070295253768563
2022Sci...375..619Y,Biology,FALSE,From start to finish—a molecular link in wound repair,"During epithelial wound repair, a subset of epithelial cells become “leaders” as the epithelial sheet collectively migrates to close the gap. These leader cells adopt distinct morphological characteristics and up-regulate migratory pathways (1, 2), but the molecular mechanism by which this subset emerges from an otherwise homogeneous population remained to be elucidated. On page 628 of this issue, Kozyrska et al. (3) find that leader cell behavior initiates with the activation of the tumor suppressor and transcription factor p53, which induces p21 expression and attendant cell cycle inhibition. Once the injury is resolved, leader cells are eliminated through p53-dependent crowding hypersensitivity. Classically, p53 becomes activated by cell stressors, including DNA damage, oncogenic expression, and hypoxia (4). In the case of mechanical disruption from wounding, p53 activation occurs through the stress kinase p38 (5). These newly found roles of p53 in leader cell emergence and elimination provide important insight into wound repair.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.001964366063475609, 0.0022877759765833616, 0.0019928538240492344, 0.00289171258918941, 0.0016573492903262377, 0.0030203291680663824, 0.9939972162246704, 0.0003969278768636286]",0.001964366063475609,0.0022877759765833616,0.0019928538240492344,0.00289171258918941,0.0016573492903262377,0.0030203291680663824,0.9939972162246704,0.0003969278768636286

Yet, discrepancies between molecular divergence estimates and the fossil record fuel ongoing debate around the timing, tempo, and drivers of this radiation. Analysis of a three-dimensional skull dataset for living and extinct placental mammals demonstrates that evolutionary rates peak early and attenuate quickly. This long-term decline in tempo is punctuated by bursts of innovation that decreased in amplitude over the past 66 million years. Social, precocial, aquatic, and herbivorous species evolve fastest, especially whales, elephants, sirenians, and extinct ungulates. Slow rates in rodents and bats indicate dissociation of taxonomic and morphological diversification.

Mutant mice display profound impairments in stress response and prosocial behaviors. Moreover, PROKR2 neurons respond most vigorously to gentle stroking and encode reward value.

In the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, the ecdysteroid 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) appears to have evolved to both control egg development when synthesized by females<SUP>2</SUP> and to induce mating refractoriness when sexually transferred by males<SUP>3</SUP>. Because egg development and mating are essential reproductive traits, understanding how Anopheles females integrate these hormonal signals can spur the design of new malaria control programs. Here we reveal that these reproductive functions are regulated by distinct sex steroids through a sophisticated network of ecdysteroid-activating/inactivating enzymes. We identify a male-specific oxidized ecdysteroid, 3-dehydro-20E (3D20E), which safeguards paternity by turning off female sexual receptivity following its sexual transfer and activation by dephosphorylation. Notably, 3D20E transfer also induces expression of a reproductive gene that preserves egg development during Plasmodium infection, ensuring fitness of infected females. Female-derived 20E does not trigger sexual refractoriness but instead licenses oviposition in mated individuals once a 20E-inhibiting kinase is repressed. Identifying this male-specific insect steroid hormone and its roles in regulating female sexual receptivity, fertility and interactions with Plasmodium parasites suggests the possibility for reducing the reproductive success of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0021103182807564735, 0.0024407708551734686, 0.0026881746016442776, 0.002597703831270337, 0.0017423814861103892, 0.0026386682875454426, 0.9950331449508667, 0.0004668687761295587]",0.0021103182807564735,0.0024407708551734686,0.0026881746016442776,0.002597703831270337,0.0017423814861103892,0.0026386682875454426,0.9950331449508667,0.0004668687761295587

Here we use a CRISPR-Cas9 screen to focus on genes that have been implicated in tRNA biogenesis, and identify a mechanism by which altered valine tRNA biogenesis enhances mitochondrial bioenergetics in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). Expression of valine aminoacyl tRNA synthetase is transcriptionally upregulated by NOTCH1, a key oncogene in T-ALL, underlining a role for oncogenic transcriptional programs in coordinating tRNA supply and demand. Limiting valine bioavailability through restriction of dietary valine intake disrupted this balance in mice, resulting in decreased leukaemic burden and increased survival in vivo. Mechanistically, valine restriction reduced translation rates of mRNAs that encode subunits of mitochondrial complex I, leading to defective assembly of complex I and impaired oxidative phosphorylation. Finally, a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen in differential valine conditions identified several genes, including SLC7A5 and BCL2, whose genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition synergized with valine restriction to reduce T-ALL growth. Our findings identify tRNA deregulation as a critical adaptation in the pathogenesis of T-ALL and provide a molecular basis for the use of dietary approaches to target tRNA biogenesis in blood malignancies.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0021192783024162054, 0.002239722292870283, 0.0022172725293785334, 0.0027180600445717573, 0.0017208076315000653, 0.0031603346578776836, 0.9946064352989197, 0.0004376643046271056]",0.0021192783024162054,0.002239722292870283,0.0022172725293785334,0.0027180600445717573,0.0017208076315000653,0.0031603346578776836,0.9946064352989197,0.0004376643046271056

The core globular domain prevented SRP from binding to signal-less ribosomes, whereas a flexibly attached domain transiently captured SRP to permit scanning of nascent chains. The emergence of an ER-targeting signal destabilized NAC’s globular domain and facilitated SRP access to the nascent chain.

Over the century since that Nobel Prize–winning discovery, there has been monumental progress in the understanding of the basic etiology of diabetes, which is now known to be an autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction of pancreatic insulin-producing β cells (see the figure). However, a cure still evades discovery, and its realization will require a dual approach that tempers autoimmunity while simultaneously restoring endogenous insulin production. Focusing on the latter, our work revealed that the resident microbiome is a promising source of previously undiscovered modulators of host β cells.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.001777886995114386, 0.0014619199791923165, 0.0016751151997596025, 0.0035584827419370413, 0.0016690618358552456, 0.005701177753508091, 0.9902708530426025, 0.0003176078025717288]",0.001777886995114386,0.0014619199791923165,0.0016751151997596025,0.0035584827419370413,0.0016690618358552456,0.005701177753508091,0.9902708530426025,0.0003176078025717288

Its introduction into US Census Bureau operations (2), however, has been controversial. Scholars, politicians, and activists have raised concerns about the integrity of census-guided democratic processes, from redistricting to voting rights. The debate raises important issues, yet most analyses of trade-offs around differential privacy overlook deeper uncertainties in census data (3). To illustrate, we examine how education policies that leverage census data misallocate funding because of statistical uncertainty, comparing the impacts of quantified data error and of a possible differentially private mechanism. We find that misallocations due to our differentially private mechanism occur on the margin of much larger misallocations due to existing data error that particularly disadvantage marginalized groups. But, we also find that policy reforms can reduce the disparate impacts of both data error and privacy mechanisms.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.002582802437245846, 0.0008947754977270961, 0.0012875715037807822, 0.019140589982271194, 0.0026276293210685253, 0.002604465698823333, 0.9738513231277466, 0.00019930129928980023]",0.002582802437245846,0.0008947754977270961,0.0012875715037807822,0.019140589982271194,0.0026276293210685253,0.002604465698823333,0.9738513231277466,0.00019930129928980023

By performing fate mapping in primary human tissue, we demonstrate that astrocytes derived from these niches populate anatomically distinct layers. Cortical plate astrocytes emerge from VZ progenitors and proliferate locally, while putative white matter astrocytes are morphologically heterogeneous and emerge from both VZ and OSVZ progenitors. Furthermore, via single-cell sequencing of morphologically defined astrocyte subtypes using Patch-seq, we identify molecular distinctions between VZ-derived cortical plate astrocytes and OSVZ-derived white matter astrocytes that persist into adulthood. Together, our study highlights a complex role for cell lineage in the diversification of human neocortical astrocytes.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0028445187490433455, 0.001001368393190205, 0.0023537827655673027, 0.004493102431297302, 0.0022333282977342606, 0.0041268677450716496, 0.9917932152748108, 0.0003446329792495817]",0.0028445187490433455,0.001001368393190205,0.0023537827655673027,0.004493102431297302,0.0022333282977342606,0.0041268677450716496,0.9917932152748108,0.0003446329792495817

Earlier this year, NASA began to accept proposals for a line of small planetary missions, with costs capped at $55 million.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.00298572750762105, 0.02547960728406906, 0.9597174525260925, 0.003591184038668871, 0.008609363809227943, 0.0004797173023689538, 0.0027711025904864073, 0.00020709354430437088]",0.00298572750762105,0.02547960728406906,0.9597174525260925,0.003591184038668871,0.008609363809227943,0.0004797173023689538,0.0027711025904864073,0.00020709354430437088

On pages 1155 and 1151 of this issue, Hayek et al. (1) and Prunas et al. (2), respectively, report measurements of how COVID-19 vaccines indirectly protect members of the same household from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Both studies leverage large health care databases in Israel that are linked to national testing data. Using the close-knit setting of households, these studies isolate how well vaccines prevent infection and how well vaccines reduce infectiousness of those who do get infected. They find reduced infections paired with variable evidence of reduced infectiousness. Studies demonstrating indirect effects increase the value of vaccines and can guide decisions about which vaccine regimens to prioritize to reduce transmission. Yet, these indirect effects are a moving target, reflecting new variants, vaccine waning, boosters, and our evolving daily lives.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0015515146078541875, 0.0016067000105977058, 0.001642028335481882, 0.010061022825539112, 0.001952917780727148, 0.0018219572957605124, 0.9871551990509033, 0.00022736376558896154]",0.0015515146078541875,0.0016067000105977058,0.001642028335481882,0.010061022825539112,0.001952917780727148,0.0018219572957605124,0.9871551990509033,0.00022736376558896154

A subfamily, palmitic acid esters of hydroxy stearic acids (PAHSAs), are anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic<SUP>1,3</SUP>. Humans and mice with insulin resistance have lower PAHSA levels in subcutaneous adipose tissue and serum<SUP>1</SUP>. PAHSA administration improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and reduces inflammation in obesity, diabetes and immune-mediated diseases<SUP>1,4-7</SUP>. The enzyme(s) responsible for FAHFA biosynthesis in vivo remains unknown. Here we identified adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL, also known as patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 2 (PNPLA2)) as a candidate biosynthetic enzyme for FAHFAs using chemical biology and proteomics. We discovered that recombinant ATGL uses a transacylation reaction that esterifies an HFA with a FA from triglyceride (TG) or diglyceride to produce FAHFAs. Overexpression of wild-type, but not catalytically dead, ATGL increases FAHFA biosynthesis. Chemical inhibition of ATGL or genetic deletion of Atgl inhibits FAHFA biosynthesis and reduces the levels of FAHFA and FAHFA-TG. Levels of endogenous and nascent FAHFAs and FAHFA-TGs are 80-90 per cent lower in adipose tissue of mice in which Atgl is knocked out specifically in the adipose tissue. Increasing TG levels by upregulating diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) activity promotes FAHFA biosynthesis, and decreasing DGAT activity inhibits it, reinforcing TGs as FAHFA precursors. ATGL biosynthetic transacylase activity is present in human adipose tissue underscoring its potential clinical relevance. In summary, we discovered the first, to our knowledge, biosynthetic enzyme that catalyses the formation of the FAHFA ester bond in mammals. Whereas ATGL lipase activity is well known, our data establish a paradigm shift demonstrating that ATGL transacylase activity is biologically important.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0021919903811067343, 0.0022749516647309065, 0.0024362527765333652, 0.0028211569879204035, 0.0017447798745706677, 0.002550079021602869, 0.9949406385421753, 0.00045657632290385664]",0.0021919903811067343,0.0022749516647309065,0.0024362527765333652,0.0028211569879204035,0.0017447798745706677,0.002550079021602869,0.9949406385421753,0.00045657632290385664

In recent decades, protein-level fitness landscapes have revealed extensive idiosyncratic epistasis among specific mutations. By contrast, other work has found ubiquitous and apparently nonspecific patterns of global diminishing-returns and increasing-costs epistasis among mutations across the genome. Here, we used a hierarchical CRISPR gene drive system to construct all combinations of 10 missense mutations from across the genome in budding yeast and measured their fitness in six environments. We show that the resulting fitness landscapes exhibit global fitness–correlated trends but that these trends emerge from specific idiosyncratic interactions. We thus provide experimental validation of recent theoretical work arguing that fitness-correlated trends can emerge as the generic consequence of idiosyncratic epistasis.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0024660362396389246, 0.001735869562253356, 0.0019759763963520527, 0.0026083122938871384, 0.0016427907394245267, 0.003827896900475025, 0.9934784173965454, 0.00039155941340141]",0.0024660362396389246,0.001735869562253356,0.0019759763963520527,0.0026083122938871384,0.0016427907394245267,0.003827896900475025,0.9934784173965454,0.00039155941340141

The structures reveal that hairpin 2 of WNT3A, which is well conserved in all Wnt ligands, inserts into PORCN from the lumenal side, and the palmitoleoyl-CoA accesses the enzyme from the cytosolic side. The catalytic histidine triggers the transfer of the unsaturated palmitoleoyl group to the target serine on the Wnt hairpin 2, facilitated by the proximity of the two substrates. The inhibitor-bound structure shows that LGK974 occupies the palmitoleoyl-CoA binding site to prevent the reaction. Thus, this work provides a mechanism for Wnt acylation and advances the development of PORCN inhibitors for cancer treatment.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0019067107932642102, 0.0017907267902046442, 0.0019350363872945309, 0.002661479637026787, 0.001614430220797658, 0.004504052922129631, 0.9924947023391724, 0.00036935717798769474]",0.0019067107932642102,0.0017907267902046442,0.0019350363872945309,0.002661479637026787,0.001614430220797658,0.004504052922129631,0.9924947023391724,0.00036935717798769474

These efforts are distinct from traditional molecular engineering—their focus is not on optimizing individual genes and proteins as therapeutics, but rather on using molecular components as modules to reprogram how cells make decisions and communicate to achieve higher-order physiological functions in vivo. This cell-centric approach is enabled by a growing tool kit of components that can synthetically control core cell-level functional outputs, such as where in the body a cell should go, what other cells it should interact with, and what messages it should transmit or receive. The power of cell engineering has been clinically validated by the development of immune cells designed to kill cancer. This same tool kit for rewiring cell connectivity is beginning to be used to engineer cell therapies for a host of other diseases and to program the self-organization of tissues and organs. By forcing the conceptual distillation of complex biological functions into a finite set of instructions that operate at the cell level, these efforts also shed light on the fundamental hierarchical logic that links molecular components to higher-order physiological function.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0015694197500124574, 0.001151672680862248, 0.001536885043606162, 0.004132600035518408, 0.0018177443416789174, 0.012249044142663479, 0.9837045073509216, 0.0002598587016109377]",0.0015694197500124574,0.001151672680862248,0.001536885043606162,0.004132600035518408,0.0018177443416789174,0.012249044142663479,0.9837045073509216,0.0002598587016109377

Because brain size is correlated with cognitive ability, complex behavior, and puzzle-solving abilities, this suggests that mammals are better able than other animals to interface with their environment (3, 4). But how and why did mammals evolve large brain sizes relative to their body mass? The question of whether the rapid morphological evolution of mammals after the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction was accompanied by equally rapid changes in brain size speaks to the role of ecology in macroevolution. On page 80 of this issue, Bertrand et al. (5) address the idea of “brawn before brain” by characterizing the timing and pattern of mammal brain development across the Early Jurassic to the middle Cenozoic (∼200 million to 30 million years ago).","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.001170783187262714, 0.0004715962859336287, 0.0046775806695222855, 0.8705437183380127, 0.002186727710068226, 0.0005611299420706928, 0.0670023262500763, 0.00011431930761318654]",0.001170783187262714,0.0004715962859336287,0.0046775806695222855,0.8705437183380127,0.002186727710068226,0.0005611299420706928,0.0670023262500763,0.00011431930761318654

Kennedy announced plans for human spaceflight to the Moon by saying, “We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.” These words marked a time when trust in and respect for science were high, and when big questions about the workings of nature were both humbling and inspiring. And although the goals of NASA’s Apollo program were not principally to do science, it inspired a generation of scientists. The ensuing years have seen this enthusiasm decline because of failings within as well as outside the world of science, as science is often ridiculed whenever findings lead to political debates. But the successful launch of a remarkable new space telescope this year has rekindled a sense of awe and wonder at the magnificence of the Universe and the thrill of human achievement.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.08737576007843018, 0.029332106932997704, 0.8233204483985901, 0.004351567942649126, 0.023517312481999397, 0.00026554809301160276, 0.0010871973354369402, 0.0002519536064937711]",0.08737576007843018,0.029332106932997704,0.8233204483985901,0.004351567942649126,0.023517312481999397,0.00026554809301160276,0.0010871973354369402,0.0002519536064937711

Using forest and prairie ecotypes of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), we characterized the genetic basis of variation in two defining traits—tail length and coat color—and discovered a 41-megabase chromosomal inversion linked to both. The inversion frequency is 90% in the dark, long-tailed forest ecotype; decreases across a habitat transition; and is absent from the light, short-tailed prairie ecotype. We implicate divergent selection in maintaining the inversion at frequencies observed in the wild, despite high levels of gene flow, and explore fitness benefits that arise from suppressed recombination within the inversion. We uncover a key role for a large, previously uncharacterized inversion in the evolution and maintenance of classic mammalian ecotypes.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0018820335390046239, 0.0013043525395914912, 0.001872621476650238, 0.004583035130053759, 0.0016431919066235423, 0.003434624057263136, 0.9911581873893738, 0.0002842267567757517]",0.0018820335390046239,0.0013043525395914912,0.001872621476650238,0.004583035130053759,0.0016431919066235423,0.003434624057263136,0.9911581873893738,0.0002842267567757517

We demonstrated that somatosensory and visual circuits are not by default segregated but require the earliest retinal activity to do so. In the embryo, somatosensory and visual circuits are intermingled in the superior colliculus, leading to cortical multimodal responses to whisker pad stimulation. At birth, these circuits segregate, and responses switch to unimodal. Blocking stage I retinal waves prolongs the multimodal configuration into postnatal life, with the superior colliculus retaining a mixed somato-visual molecular identity and defects arising in the spatial organization of the visual system. Hence, the superior colliculus mediates the timely segregation of sensory modalities in an input-dependent manner, channeling specific sensory cues to their appropriate sensory pathway.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.0020156693644821644, 0.001999840373173356, 0.001942051574587822, 0.0035196468234062195, 0.0016827879007905722, 0.0029959736857563257, 0.9940833449363708, 0.0003966704825870693]",0.0020156693644821644,0.001999840373173356,0.001942051574587822,0.0035196468234062195,0.0016827879007905722,0.0029959736857563257,0.9940833449363708,0.0003966704825870693

2018Sci...362...11C,Planetary Science,FALSE,BepiColombo set to probe Mercury's mysteries,"Tiny and relatively ignored, Mercury holds outsize mysteries. Only two spacecraft have made the difficult journey to its sun-baked environs. NASA's Mariner 10 flew by the planet in the 1970s but getting a spacecraft into orbit around Mercury without it plummeting into the sun proved tricky. It wasn't until the 1980s that mission planners worked out the complex series of gravity assists needed and longer still to design spacecraft able to endure the sun's heat. The next visitor, NASA's MESSENGER, finally arrived in 2011 and promptly upset many theories about the planet's formation and evolution through observations of Mercury's skewed magnetic field, its outsize iron core, and strange lakelike depressions perhaps carved by escaping volatile elements. Researchers now hope to get answers from the planet's third and most ambitious visitor, the European-Japanese mission BepiColombo, a pair of probes due for launch on 20 October.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.004061250016093254, 0.05597793683409691, 0.8944478631019592, 0.005189934279769659, 0.00985818449407816, 0.000295928621198982, 0.0014208704233169556, 0.00017095604562200606]",0.004061250016093254,0.05597793683409691,0.8944478631019592,0.005189934279769659,0.00985818449407816,0.000295928621198982,0.0014208704233169556,0.00017095604562200606

Until its demise, IMAGE provided unparalleled views of solar storms crashing into Earth's magnetosphere, a capability that has not been replaced since. The amateur astronomer was on the search for Zuma, a classified U.S. satellite that's believed to have failed after launch. He instead discovered IMAGE, broadcasting again, likely thanks to a reboot that occurred after its batteries drained during a past solar eclipse. NASA scientists are now working to communicate with the satellite in the hopes of reviving its six scientific instruments.","['Astronomy', 'Heliophysics', 'Planetary Science', 'Earth Science', 'NASA-funded Biophysics', 'Other Physics', 'Other', 'Text Garbage']","[0.001936569344252348, 0.9749047756195068, 0.08410582691431046, 0.002896360820159316, 0.009063397534191608, 0.0011033208575099707, 0.0019446801161393523, 0.00032998344977386296]",0.001936569344252348,0.9749047756195068,0.08410582691431046,0.002896360820159316,0.009063397534191608,0.0011033208575099707,0.0019446801161393523,0.00032998344977386296
